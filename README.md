# NotifyTwitch

Get Desktop notifications when your followed Twitch streamers come online and offline
## Installation
gem install notify-twitch

## Usage

```
notify-twitch
```
### Currently this only works on Linux
On the first run, it will generate a config file for your username and your client-id
You should be get your client-id after making a twitch app.

At some point I plan on using the Oauth auth flow to avoid people making their own apps.
